i started learning c++ on may 18, 2025. 
i was watching an online course for
computer science in harvard. I got 
interested, so i learned some syntax.
i learned output, input, if statement, 
as well as for loop. after learning them
i decided to make some project, which is
why i made this github account to display 
them. what i find very fulfilling is that
it is nice to create projects without 
looking at other codes for reference 
and using chatgpt. i was just trying to 
figure things out, i tried to think
about what to put, but it's really 
for difficult for a beginner like me.
but i somehow managed to make 4 projects.
it felt like my random breakdowns 
yesterday were being rewarded. hopefully 
as you look through my account, you'll 
be motivated to code even though I'm 
only doing basics.
